- Q-Learning
- Scratch Implementations of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## ü§î FAQ

### What is reinforcement learning?

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. It learns from the rewards or penalties it receives from its actions.

### Do I need programming skills to use these projects?

No, you do not need programming skills. The applications are designed to be user-friendly for non-technical users. Just follow the instructions in this guide.

### Can I modify the code?

Yes, if you are interested in learning more, you can explore the code. However, we recommend that only users with a basic understanding of programming do this.

## üåê Community and Support

If you have questions or need help, we encourage you to visit the Issues section of the repository. There, you can ask questions and get support from other users and contributors.
